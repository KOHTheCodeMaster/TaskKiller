# Task Killer - Android Application

The main motive of making this Task Killer App is to get rid of Unnecessary Cluttering of
Notifications by lots of applications running in background.

Force Stop Background Applications specifically those that clutters the most with unwanted
notifications. Especially Banking & E-commerce applications bombarding with pointless offers &
promos, cluttering up the notifications tab. Although there's an option for CLEAR ALL, but it'd
remove some important notifications in between as well.

Hence, Task Killer will allow to force stop those specific set of applications which creates most of
the noise. Also, It'll save up battery life & boost performance to some extent if used up wisely.
